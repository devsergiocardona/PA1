# PA1: Process Scheduler

This repository contains a Python script (`scheduler-gpt.py`) that implements three process scheduling algorithms:

- FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
- Preemptive SJF (Shortest Job First)
- Round Robin

It reads an input file (with a `.in` extension) and produces an output file (with a `.out` extension) that shows the scheduling log and metrics.
